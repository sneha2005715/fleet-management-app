# Fleet Management App


Simple two-page Fleet Management App (Login + Admin Dashboard).


## How to use


1. Create a GitHub repo named `fleet-management-app` and clone it locally.
2. Copy the files from this canvas into your local repo.
3. Commit regularly (every ~20 minutes) with meaningful messages.
4. Open `index.html` in the browser. Login with:
- Email: `admin@gmail.com`
- Password: `admin1234`


## Notes
- Minimal styling, focuses on JavaScript logic.
- Vehicles are stored in `localStorage` so they persist across page reloads.
- Replace the placeholder vehicle image (if desired) with your required sample image.
